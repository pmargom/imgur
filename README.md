# Imgur

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This app is just another flutter project to play and learn.

It is an app that allows you to search galleroes by consuming the api https://api.imgur.com. To run the app follow the steps below:

- Download the code.
- In the root folder run `flutter pub get && flutter run`

If everything goes fine, you should see something like this:

 <img src="./screenshots/1.png" style="width:240px;" />  <img src="./screenshots/2.png" style="width:240px;" />  <img src="./screenshots/3.png" style="width:240px;" />
